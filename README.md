#### By Michael G Connelly

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* MS Tests


## Description

This console application was created as my first independent project in the C# / .NET course at Epicodus. It demonstrates my understanding of Test Driven Development in C#. The console application must include the following functionality:
* There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.
* When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.
* A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.
* The application will return the total cost of the order.
* Pierre offers the following deal for Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
* Pierre offers the following deal for Pastry: Buy 3, get 1 free. A single pastry costs $2.
